              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I’m really happy we
              are in Chicago—about 100 years ago my paternal grandfather
              arrived in this city from Greece and found work in the steel mills
              of nearby Gary, Indiana. My Dad was raised here and today my
              beautiful 20-month old granddaughters Bianca and Indigo live here
              with my daughter and son-in-law.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But despite all those
              happy Chicago connections, I was born and raised in St. Louis and
              feel no compunction to change my Cardinal hat. (Bill puts on a St.
              Louis Cardinals baseball hat.)</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It’s been just a few
              hours since I’ve been elected, but I’ve been thinking about
              SigEp a long time and want to share my thoughts.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the next two
              years we will be preparing to celebrate our Centennial. Our first
              98 years have seen SigEp become America’s preeminent fraternity.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For nearly two
              decades, 17 consecutive years, </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">S
              F E</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> has been selected as their
              fraternity by more men than any other. Quite a performance.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And yet, as Norm told
              us Thursday night, despite booming college enrollments and a
              booming economy – for the last seven years the number of men
              joining fraternities is in steady, year-after-year, decline. SigEp
              may be falling less rapidly than our peers but we, too, are
              dropping.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh we’ve seen more
              dramatic declines—but they were during WWI, the Great Depression
              of the ‘20s and ‘30s, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, the drug-hazed,
              anti-everything ‘60s and ‘70s. But we have never before seen
              declines in good economic times and strong undergraduate
              enrollment.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We, all fraternities,
              must be doing something wrong. And I think I know what it is.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In May, 1997, our dear
              Frank Ruck told a gathering of National Interfraternity Council
              leaders and I quote: &quot;At the close of the 20<sup>th</sup>
              Century the basic motivation and ideals of our respective founders
              are long gone; we know that much is wrong and sometimes harmful
              with our Greek system. Focus on fun and entertainment dominates
              the culture of many, if not all of us, giving shallow lip service
              to our roots. The reality is that in far too many locations we do
              harm to our young people—and that realization really
              hurts.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, it does, Frank.</font></p>
              <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tragos.gif" align="texttop" width="114" height="113"></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">From my years in
              advertising I know that perceptions developed over time really do
              reflect reality. Although it has been a minority of Greeks –
              there’s been enough stupidity repeated over many years that we
              have earned our current reputation. All of us.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The pejorative
              &quot;frat boy&quot; label pinned on anybody—from hard drinking
              ball players to presidential candidates considered intellectual
              lightweights—reflects an accumulation of years of ridiculous,
              hazardous, juvenile, irresponsible, and often illegal behavior.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For serious students,
              fraternities are viewed as a marginal anti-academic anachrony.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To many college
              administrators fraternities are an irrelevant nuisance. To many of
              our own alumni, an embarrassment.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Is it so difficult to
              understand the steady decline in the attractiveness of the Greek
              letter idea to young men entering college today? Is an organized
              society of friends an irrelevant, outmoded idea? Or have we
              betrayed our original purpose?</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Robert Frost thought
              the saddest word in the English language was not disease, poverty,
              war, prejudice or even death—but betrayal. Think of the gravity
              of betraying one’s family, wife, friends, religion, principles,
              country—or oath and obligation.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Those of us here
              tonight, undergraduates, alumni, their wives, are SigEp fanatics
              for some set of reasons. Something happened to make us so. I know
              why I am.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Like you I learned
              things the classroom didn’t teach. How to sell an intangible
              idea like friendship in rush. How to lead a group of men by
              conviction and enthusiasm without any carrots or sticks. I got
              into advertising thanks to two SigEp alums. I made friends 46
              years ago who are still among my very best friends. But there’s
              more. For me, the son of Greek immigrants, </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">S
              F E</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> gave me a feeling of
              belonging, of being welcome and included in the American dream
              that I had never really felt before my initiation.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Each alumnus has his
              special reason for staying involved. And when you look in your
              heart, you do, too.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Alums here tonight and
              many thousands who are not, share this feeling of indebtedness to
              our Fraternity. That's why so many give their time, talent, and
              money. We work with you to avoid betraying our founding ideals,
              centered on F , and pass on this beautiful concept intact for the
              next generation of America’s leaders. It’s going to take many
              years of walking the talk of a virtuous life—of living it, to
              destroy the &quot;frat boy&quot; damage…</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To do it we are going
              to have to do exactly what Frank Ruck told the NIC was needed. Not
              cosmetic, but major substantive change.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">No Fraternity is
              better prepared or capable to effect change than SigEp.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because we’ve
              innovated before, many times in our history, it’s our heritage.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You know our many
              firsts. First national philanthropy, first professional
              headquarters staff to help chapters; innovations like resident
              scholars, the TIPS program, the National Housing Corporation, are
              but a partial listing of the things we did first, that
              step-by-step made us the best.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Of all our bright
              ideas there are two which stand out. They required great courage.
              Both happened in a span of about 10 years, from the late ‘40s to
              late ‘50s. They redefined Fraternities then, too.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The first was the
              handiwork of the Executive Director of the time, Bill Hindman, an
              Ivy Leaguer from the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Delta,
              ably assisted in Richmond Headquarters by our dear Frank Ruck, a
              graduate of the Big 10’s Michigan Alpha Chapter.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">These two men saw the
              booming college enrollments across our country after WWII, thanks
              to the GI Bill that gave more men than ever a chance at a college
              degree. They saw that this democratization of education would
              allow smaller state or private schools to grow and be able to
              support Greek systems. So SigEp was the first to go to campus
              after campus of formerly streetcar or mining or engineering or
              agricultural or teachers-only colleges. Most of those schools
              blossomed and so has SigEp. Seems obvious to you today, but it was
              revolutionary then. We did it. We did it first. We were copied and
              we shattered the fetters of exclusion of misplaced elitism which
              was the negative fraternity stereotype of that period.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And 40 years ago this
              week at the Conclave in Washington, D.C., this Fraternity, founded
              by 12 mostly Southern Baptist divinity students once again
              embraced change.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1959, five years
              before Selma, and to our everlasting credit, </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">S
              F E</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> became the first major
              national fraternity to reject the prejudices of the past and
              abolished all forms of membership restrictions, racial or
              religious.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Today you take this
              for granted, and this is as it should be, but it wasn’t obvious
              then. It nearly tore this Fraternity apart. It was decided by
              young men like you in Conclave.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It was an experience
              many of us in this room shared and remember with pride and
              emotion. A great moment that bonded brothers from all parts of the
              country. Another reason why we’re here tonight.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Again, the others
              followed. And, if we have climbed to today’s preeminence since
              that day it’s because we dared correct errors of the past. We
              dared to be, really be different. We held ourselves and </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">S
              F E</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> to a higher standard.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So, it is not
              chest-pounding pride but our track record that should encourage us
              to believe we can imagine an even greater SigEp…if we approach
              it in the same way, doing what we think is right for our </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">S
              F E</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> .</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Let’s start by
              expecting more of ourselves. Let’s be intolerant toward the
              &quot;frat boys&quot; among us who rob us of our dignity and
              destroy our caché. Let’s work not on the sizzle but the steak,
              the product we offer young America. Not just with new
              programs—but a single-minded focus on living what we say we’re
              all about—the Balanced Man ideal.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Somewhere along the
              line we forgot where we were going with the Balanced Man. It
              became a slogan, or a rush tool, or simply a performance criterion
              for winning a Buchanan Cup.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We forgot the meaning
              of the Balanced Man.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The ancient Greeks had
              an axiom &quot;sound mind, sound body.&quot; It was believed the
              body’s good health was vital because it was the vessel of the
              mind. They believed physical training was necessary to keep the
              body at its peek so that the mind could also operate at its best.
              And 2,500 years later modern medicine has come to the same
              conclusion.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">These same old Greeks
              believed just as the body was the vessel of the mind—the mind
              housed your humanity. That you are what you know. That you had to
              exercise your mind for it to develop—just like the body.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">They believed, like
              our ritual, that the pursuit of knowledge didn’t end when you
              left academic walls but was a life-long endeavor and that, as your
              knowledge grew so would your wisdom, and thus your enjoyment of
              this life—your humanity.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And for them, as I
              hope for us—these knowledge seeking minds in healthy bodies
              offered the best chance of achieving not only a virtuous lifetime
              but a beautiful soul ready to approach God.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Balanced men will not
              poison their bodies with tobacco, drugs, excessive alcohol, will
              not be brutes to their fellow men with stupid hazing with meanness
              of any sort, will not disrespect women, will not allow hate to
              poison their view of their fellow man, hating because they are
              different—different race, different religion, different
              ethnicity, different sexual orientation—because Balanced Men
              know we are all in God’s image.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And on that
              potentially demagogic and divisive issue of sexual
              orientation—just look at the good you did these past 48 hours.
              Another prejudice is no longer acceptable behavior for SigEps. And
              Balanced Men with their beautiful souls perform the good deeds of
              a Project America, of Habitat for Humanity, or teaching inner city
              youths, not to cover up, much less absolve shortcomings of how
              they live on a daily basis, but because good souls do good.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Chapters that <u>practice</u>
              the sound body and mind ideal win top scholastic and intramural
              honors on their campuses and Buchanan Cups here.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">They recruit more of
              the best men than anybody because they live, don’t just talk the
              Balanced Man idea. Their attractiveness is visible. We have more
              such chapters than anybody, but only 50 or 60 out of 260. Way too
              few to change perceptions.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some people think the
              Greek letter idea is so sullied that the trend is and should be
              toward extinction.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But you know there are
              Greek letters we respect, like </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">F
              B K</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> . Why don’t we dare set a
              new standard? That our Greek letters, in time, achieve a
              reputation that goes <u>beyond</u> </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">F
              B K</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> . Because </font><font face="Symbol" size="2">S</font><font face="Arial" size="2">

              glorifies individual scholastic achievement. Grade point. Fine.
              When we’re great, we match that and add the knowledge that comes
              from learning about ones fellow man by belonging to a large
              diverse group that knows one another well enough to call each
              other Brothers. True friends.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We need you to go back
              to your chapter and dare to talk about our Balanced Man ambitions,
              and idealism. To recognize where we fall short and act. Because
              before we can get the very best men on your campus interested in
              taking this journey with you, your chapter Brothers need to
              understand what the Balanced Man means for <u>their</u> lives
              first. What they need to work on to approach the Balanced Man
              goal.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Too idealistic? Only
              if you believe the idealism of the 12 men of Ryland Hall was. Only
              if the ritual’s interest is its secretiveness. If the Creed is
              mouthed with meaningless words. Only if you think the Founders’
              idea of a new and different national Fraternity was. Brothers, we
              came along 50 years after most of our competition. And we rose to
              the top.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Too different from
              your competitors? Our Fraternity has always dared to be different.
              It’s your heritage.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A couple of things you
              should know about me…</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I think you know you
              elected a Greek Greek.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The poet Theocrites
              wrote in 252 BC talking about the Trojan war, something that has
              always encouraged me to develop a relentless approach to life’s
              challenges. &quot;The Greeks took Troy because they never gave up
              trying.&quot; So be assured this is not just a speech. We are
              going to go after our Troy, the &quot;frat boy&quot; stereotype.
              We will demolish that Troy. That’s my Greek side. After 39 years
              of marriage to my wife, who is a Dane, I have also become a Viking
              by osmosis.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We are going to win.
              Not with more rush tools, or slogans, but really changing who we
              are—the quality of our humanity. Do that first, help each other
              focus on that relentlessly as the Greeks did at Troy and
              everything, all the growth and success we need, will follow.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And I promise you, as
              you tackle change, your older Brothers will be at your side. I
              will do my utmost to get the resources of our Fraternity behind
              your efforts. To focus those resources to add a tangible reality
              to the high ideals of the Balanced Man, and help you achieve them.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We can accelerate your
              understanding of the importance of what you put into your body,
              the poison of excess, we can dedicate space in our houses for
              exercise. We can encourage, sponsor annual physicals that measure,
              not how much you can bench press, but your cholesterol, blood
              pressure and get you into the habit of monitoring your health. We
              need to take big and small concrete steps to help you develop the
              body as vessel of the mind. We will.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And the mind—the
              pursuit of knowledge and the virtuous life. What can we do beyond
              bench-marking our scholastic performance against the all student
              GPA and the awards and scholarships we already offer? Can we
              really change, and foster environments in our houses that truly
              promote the sound mind?</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We are all or will be
              wired for computers. But we need to go beyond that. Can we make
              our houses small college residences of 50 or 60 or 80 men with a
              professor or associate professor who lives with us, and his or her
              spouse, kids, and dog and whose presence helps foster a more
              home-like and academic atmosphere <u>all the time</u>? Whose
              presence encourages the visits of fellow professors of
              anthropology, ethics or Phys. Ed.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And, instead of having
              these visits and dinners haphazardly, or as part of a brownie
              point count toward some award for being a good fraternity, truly
              change how we live, a pro-academic, pro-intellectual atmosphere
              that goes beyond the pursuit of the diploma or grade point. That
              seeks to expand the horizon of the mind. Helping you to your best
              expression of yourself. Would such an undertaking reignite our
              alumni, your Alumni Board, our NHC, our Foundation, to come up
              with the resources it takes to build and support such an
              environment? I bet it will. And we have the creativity to develop
              ideas that foster scholarship in chapters where we don’t live
              together. Every SigEp gathering, from chapter meetings, Carlson
              Leadership Academies, and Conclaves.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As your new president
              I ask you to think, and act on all of this in the name and in
              honor of our past, our founders, and our 240,000 brothers.
              Certainly, but most of all in your name, for you.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the spirit of the
              Balanced Man—the best you. Let SigEp be that society of friends
              that has grown to understand that with our Balanced Man we own a
              big idea that represents timeless values.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our relevance for the
              future, our very existence is in your hands—and the hourglass is
              in front of us all.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">May the Lord watch
              over each of us as we take leave one from the other. May we
              remember the fellowship of this great Fraternity that rejoices in
              its diversity, that looks down on nobody because they are
              different because we are all made in God’s image.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">May you go back to
              your campus aware of the chance you have to build a beautiful soul
              while developing your best humanity by truly understanding and
              living the balanced life of healthy body and mind. Relentlessly.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For it is time again
              to mind our very own knitting and prove to collegiate America that
              there is worth in Greek letters and that today’s Sigma Phi
              Epsilon, this society of friends, of Balanced Men, by the actions
              of their daily lives honors <i>Virtue, Diligence and Brotherly
              Love</i> so much that they dare take up the challenge of massive
              fundamental change that dares to imagine that a goal as high as

              is only our latest journey of change.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Such a Sigma Phi
              Epsilon is a product that will attract young America as never
